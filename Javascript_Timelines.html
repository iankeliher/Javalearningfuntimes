What is your name?
Well, hello [name], do you believe in alternate timelines? Yes/No?
	Yes—Good. Personally, I was skeptical until I aided in the translation of a Turkish entomologist’s diary, who believed that the outlines of other dimensions were traced on the exoskeletons of insects. So as they moved through space, the outlines on their exoskeletons collectively showed the expansions and contractions of other worlds. And it would seem plausible do you hear that?
		Yes—I’m terribly sorry the rollercoaster runs right by my window. Where were we now? Timelines? Insects? Something else?
			Timelines—Oh, yes, that’s right. How old are you?
				(x<20) I don’t know if this will impact you much. You must sit with me longer. At least until your 20th birthday. Here, have some wine.
				(x>20) Perfect. So you have sat by the Rhine and felt the breeze and mashed the beetles in the grass together, making constellations of their insides on the insides of your hands. I believe that you are ready to see the alternate timelines which you could have chosen to participate in. We don’t go backwards, learn this.
			Insects—I don’t believe that’s true. I believe you’re trying to mislead me. I don’t trust you anymore. Leave my house. I was going to share something with you, but I see it would have ended up in the trash. Don’t even look in the console.
			Other—I don’t know if that’s accurate, [name]. Perhaps it is. My memory is beginning to fade at this point. You’re probably expecting me to say something about the many lives I’ve lived. But I’d rather hear about you.
		No—If you’re quiet you’ll hear it. Do you hear it yet?
			Yes—It must sound strange from your position, but it’s really nothing more than the rollercoaster that runs by my window. There was one occasion where a child vomited on my windowsill. It was difficult to clean.

	No—Is there anything that keeps you from believing? [answer]
	Well, I hardly think that “[answer]” is a very good reason to discount the notion. After all, you know the saying. But then there is the issue at hand, do you remember what that was? Timelines? Something else? Or, rather, I shall just show you, yes?
